# Welcome to @frgiovanna's portfolio âœ¨

This is a project that I designed from start to finish. 

In addition to serving as a way to show my work to the world, through it I had the opportunity to develop my first design prototype, aligned with good design practices and thinking about a good user experience, while still adding my personal touch to the project.

It was also an opportunity to put into practice good development practices based on what I have learned and worked on over all these years.


**Hope you enjoy it.** ðŸ¥°
